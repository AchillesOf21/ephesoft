 * TableModelService is a service interface that provides data for displaying in a GWT AdvancedTable widget.
 * 
 * Life-cycle: 1) getRowsCount() is called by the client to estimate the number of available records on the server. 2) getRows() is
 * called by the client to display a particular page (a subset of the available data) 3) getIndividualRowCounts() is called by the
 * client to get the count of similar types of records. 4) getNextBatchInstance() is called by the client to get the next record from
 * the server. The implementing class can use database or other back-end as data source.
 * 
 * The first table column is considered row identifier (primary key).
